# Making Gossip More Robust with Lifeguard  - IMP

  Collectively called Lifeguard, these extensions reduce by 50x the false positives produced by the failure detector and allow us to detect true failures faster.

  Distributed systems such as 
  - BitTorrent, 
  - Apache Cassandra, 
  - Microsoft Orleans, and 
  - HashiCorp Consul commonly use Gossip protocols. 

  They are typically embedded to provide features such as 
  - cluster membership (who is in the cluster), 
  - failure detection (which members are alive), and 
  - event broadcast.

  Their peer to peer nature often makes them much more scalable and reliable than centralized approaches to solving the same problem.
