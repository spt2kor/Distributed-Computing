# SQL vs NoSQL or MySQL vs MongoDB
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y

SQL - Relational Data Base - Table Schema Based
  strict Schema Based.
Type of relations: 
  one to one
  one to many
  many to many
  
No-SQL = Mongo DB, AWS Dynamo DB.
  Mongo DB -(Humongous) 
  Data Base = Shop
  Collections(Tables in SQL) = Users and Orders
  Documents (rows/records in SQL) = look like JSON
  Dont Follow Same Schema , rows can have diff schema/columns
  No/Few Relations , keep all required data in same Table/record.
  cause duplicate data, but all is present in same place,so no nned to query on other tables.
  good for more reads, and less write DB.
